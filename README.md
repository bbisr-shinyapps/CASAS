# CASAS
Cancer Survival Analysis Suite

CASAS is a shiny R based tool for interactive survival analysis and visualization of results. The tool provides a web-based one stop shop to perform the following types of survival analysis:  quantile, landmark and competing risks, in addition to standard survival analysis.  The interface makes it easy to perform such survival analyses and obtain results using the interactive Kaplan-Meier and cumulative incidence plots.  Survival results are displayed in tables that include log rank p-values and hazard ratios, along with their significance is reported for a user specified univariate analysis.  For several quantile survival analyses from multiple cancer types, a single, summary grid is constructed.
